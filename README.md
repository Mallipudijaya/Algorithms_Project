graph.py		    Contains the class for a graph.  
vertex.py		    Contains the class for a vertex.  
kruskal_heap.py             Conatins min heap sort for kruskal  
heap.py			    Contains the heap data structure with DEL,MAX,INSERT sub-routines and HeapSort function.  
graph_generation.py	    Contains the functions for generating a random sparse(G1) or a random dense(G2) graph.  
algorithm.py		    Contains the implementations of the following functions:  
				dij(g,s,t) Dijkstra's without heap  
				dij_heap(g,s,t) Dijkstra's with heap  
				kruskal(g,s,t) Kruskal's with edges sorted using HeapSort  
main.py			    This is the main file through which testing is done.
